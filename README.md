# Dotfiles

Dotfiles that make anywhere feel like `$HOME`.

## Getting Started

I use Dotbot to install my dotfiles. It's an elegant, decently-lightweight solution that works well for me.

### Installing

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jungaretti/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.bash
```

## Built With

- [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot): A tool that bootstraps your dotfiles
