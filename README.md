# Dotfiles

Dotfiles that make anywhere feel like `/home`.

## Prerequisites

Are you ready to set up a new computer for me? Fire up your favorite terminal and let's get started!

### Install Homebrew

On macOS, [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Add Oh My Zsh's `eval` command to `~/.zprofile`.

```
# Homebrew
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### Install Oh My Zsh

Install Zsh and [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

If needed, change the default shell to Zsh.

```
sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh "$USER"
```

### Generate SSH Key

Use `ssh-keygen` to generate a new SSH key.

```sh
# Set to username@hostname[.home|work]
read KEY_COMMENT

ssh-keygen -o -a 256 -t ed25519 -C "$KEY_COMMENT"
```

#### Add SSH Key to GitHub

You must add the new SSH key to GitHub in order to clone this repository. Visit https://github.com/settings/keys or use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/manual/) to add the key.

```sh
# Don't add your SSH key yet!
gh auth login -s write:public_key

gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub --title "$KEY_COMMENT"
```

## Install (these) Dotfiles

Clone this repo and install my dotfiles using `./install.sh`.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jungaretti/dotfiles.git

cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

### Install Apps and Tools

Install tools with custom installers:

- [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)

Check out [jungaretti/stuff](https://github.com/jungaretti/stuff) to install all of my apps and tools.

### Configure B2 Backups

I use [restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) and [crestic](https://github.com/nils-werner/crestic) to back up my data to [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html).

Log into Backblaze to create a new storage bucket and generate a new application key. Then, add the following lines to `~/.zshenv` and paste their values from Backblaze.

```sh
# Backblaze application key
export B2_ACCOUNT_ID=KEY_ID
export B2_ACCOUNT_KEY=APPLICATION_KEY
```

Create a `<host>.password.txt` file or `export RESTIC_PASSWORD` to unlock the repository automatically. See `src/crestic/config.cfg` for more details.

## Notes

- I use MaterialDark from https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes.
