# Stuff for macOS

I use Homebrew to manage my tools and apps. Homebrew Bundle makes it easy to install Homebrew packages and GUI applications on macOS.

## Getting Started

> "Ed una lupa, che di tutte brame sembiava carca ne la sua magrezza, e molte genti fé già viver grame" ([Infero I, 49-51](https://digitaldante.columbia.edu/dante/divine-comedy/inferno/inferno-1/)).
